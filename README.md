## Advanced Machine Learning
This place holds my projects and paper notes for advanced machine learning techniques.

[My Index page for all repositories.](https://github.com/zxfsheep/Index/blob/master/README.md)

## Projects

* [Classifying Lego bricks using TensorFlow.](https://github.com/zxfsheep/deep-learning-lab/blob/master/lego_bricks.ipynb) Many adjustments were made according to the lessons learned and mistakes found in the previous experiment.

* [Classifying blood cell types using TensorFlow.](https://github.com/zxfsheep/deep-learning-lab/blob/master/blood_cell.ipynb)

## Paper Notes
These notes are written with my own interpretation and thoughts.

* [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/zxfsheep/deep-learning-lab/blob/master/summaries/RL.md): Tasks which require learning to improve performance in a random, new environment.

* [Computer Vision](https://github.com/zxfsheep/deep-learning-lab/blob/master/summaries/Vision.md): Tasks such as objection detection, bounding box labeling, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation.
