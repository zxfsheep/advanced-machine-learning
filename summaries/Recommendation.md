* [**"SVD"**](http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html): Low rank matrix factorization. Not really SVD in linear algebra.
* [**"SVD"++**](https://github.com/gpfvic/IRR/blob/master/Factorization%20meets%20the%20neighborhood-%20a%20multifaceted%20collaborative%20filtering%20model.pdf): A user is not only represented by its vector, but also the bag of vectors corresponding to the user's items.
* [**Factorization Machine**](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf): Each feature column is embedded as a vector <img src="/summaries/tex/9f7365802167fff585175c1750674d42.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=12.61896569999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> in some fixed dimensional space, and the interaction between columns are modeled by <img src="/summaries/tex/b473971bb963ec1dcf3c416264e884f6.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=70.34428004999998pt height=17.723762100000005pt/>. These are defined independently of sample values. If a sample has <img src="/summaries/tex/b4186a7f11d640316d31f146ea79ef3f.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=37.67316464999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> at those columns, the contribution to the target (label, regression,...) is <img src="/summaries/tex/4708fabcee17611f65ad348a9dd89266.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=106.09955399999998pt height=17.723762100000005pt/>. When we just have two categorical variables, users and items, each row is a pair of user and item, one-hot encoded, then this is equivalent to matrix factorization. But FM is much more general.
